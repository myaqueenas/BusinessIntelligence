John Treharne founded The Gym Group in 2008 (Mintel, 2009; Marketline, 2015). In June 2019, the company is the second largest gym brand in UK with 169 sites, about 750,000 members and 1,423 employees (Mintel, 2019; Fame, 2020) and ‘The Gym Group GYM:GBX’, (2020, June 15) reports that it ranks 25th in terms of market capitalization for all travel and leisure companies in the UK. The gyms belonging to The Gym Group operate 24 hours a day and 7 days, offering customers a lower membership cost compared to their competitors (Marketline, 2015). According to the Mintel report (2019), 98% of its revenue come from membership costs but they aim to diversify their sales by selling clothing, health food and protein supplements. They also try to offer affordable and flexible membership products to attract more customers. The report (Mintel, 2019) also announced that 2018 was the busiest year for the company. For example, it has opened the largest number of sites in history, such as opening new sites or acquiring sites from competitors by taking an aggressive strategy.

### 2. Industry and competitor analysis

#### 2-1. Market Forecast
The Gym Group is basically a company that runs gyms and generates revenue from membership costs to customers. According to Mintel data (2019), the frequency of leisure activities is gradually decreasing or stagnant, but more gyms are opening faster than before, and related industries are growing. Furthermore, the number of gym members is expected to continue to increase over the next five years. The total revenues of fitness clubs are expected to rise to approximately 3.8 billion pounds in 2024, although the total sales are about 3.3 billion pounds in 2019.

#### 2-2. Consumer Spending
The number of gym members, which accounted for only 15 percent of the respondents in 2018, grew to 18 percent in the 2019 survey. Also, 19 percent said they considered joining the club even though they are not currently members of the gym. This means that there are many potential customers in the gym industry and an industry pie will grow (Mintel, 2019).

#### 2-3. Market Share
The Gym Group ranks second in the gym operations industry and the leader is PureGym. PureGym has a high membership growth rate of 7.5 percent a year and has 242 sites and about 1.2 million members in 2019. This shows a significant difference compared to the second ranked The Gym Group. However, the third ranked Anytime Fitness is chasing The Gym Group with 165 sites. In terms of membership numbers, David Lloyd follows The Gym Group (Mintel, 2019). It is worth mentioning that The Gym Group does not have a membership contract and the membership fee is cheaper (The Gym Group Consumer Site, 2020), but Anytime Fitness has a membership contract and is relatively expensive compared to the company. However, they provide high service to customers (Anytime Fitness, 2020). This may not be a competitor because the positions of the two companies are different. However, strategy of fitness centre industry leader PureGym is to have low membership monthly fees without membership contracts (PureGym, 2020). It is the same strategy and position as The Gym Group, it may be right to judge PureGym as a true competitor rather than Anytime Fitness. However, it is more important for The Gym Group to attract new customers with its competitors than to focus on strategies that take customers away from them. In other words, growing pie in the industry. Although it failed, PureGym and The Gym Group also discussed the merger in 2014 (‘Sports Direct to open budget’, 2014, November 11). Competitors of The Gym Group may be other sports companies such as football and basketball, not other gym companies. Even Netflix or TV companies, not sports companies, could be their competitors (Boddy & Paton, 1998; Monson, 2015).

### 4. A Market analysis
#### SWOT
Strength
The Gym Group has 169 outlets as of 2019, the second largest in the industry. Through these numerous outlets, their products could be distributed nationwide, and they could also enjoy advertising effects. In addition, The Gym Group is a low-cost brand in the industry that is easily accessible to consumers (Mintel, 2018; Mintel 2019). In fact, according to Mintel's survey (2019), the biggest reason for not using a gym is cost of membership fees. Also, The Gym Group has millions of followers on its social media platform and could communicate with their customers instantly (The Gym Group Plc, 2020).

Weakness
98% of revenue come from membership costs. Aside from its core business, sales are limited, and it is difficult to strengthen other product segments (Fame, 2020; Mintel 2019). The turnover rate of 1,423 employees and coaches from various backgrounds is high and it is difficult to continuously increase their capabilities, and their wages could be a burden during the COVID-19 disaster (Fame 2020; ‘Boris Johnson says he expects’, 2020, March 19). Moreover, the profitability ratio and Net Contribution are lower than the industry average (Fame, 2020).

Opportunity
The pie of industry is steadily growing, and 19 percent of Mintel Survey (2019) respondents are considering becoming health club members. It is also trying to improve its profit and premium image by launching a product called 'Live it' and renovating old fitness centres. In addition, their various online sessions and products could bring diversification of profits. (Mintel, 2018; The Gym Group Consumer Site, 2020).

Threat
The Gym Group is a global company and is sensitive to market and political volatility in each country. Also, rising annual wages can put pressure on the company's profitability. In 2018, The Gym Group has reduced advertising costs to raise awareness of low-end brands and increase profitability. However, reducing advertising costs while brand recognition is not yet high could be a big adventure and a threat (Fame, 2020; Mintel, 2017; Mintel, 2018; Mintel 2019).

### 5. Your overall analysis
The covid-19 Pandemic has decimated the gym industry, but it has continued to grow before (‘Boris Johnson says he expects’, 2020, March 19; Mintel, 2019). Also, gyms are irreplaceable and online classes could be a new selling tool (‘Businesses react to virus shutdown 2020’, March 20). As people may be more concerned with health than before due to the influence of the pandemic, business is likely to grow further (‘When will gyms re-open after’, 2020, April 23). Therefore, The Gym Groups will survive.
